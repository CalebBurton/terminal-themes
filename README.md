# Terminal Themes
A small repo for custom themes that I've created for my terminal.

I use iterm2 and oh-my-zsh, which each allow for custom themes. I forked the Cobalt2 theme from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com), then modified it to align roughly with [Northwestern University's branding guidelines](https://www.northwestern.edu/brand/).
